# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Import math header file package
### Step 2: 
Get user input for coordinates of x and y
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
Round off the derived answer to two decimal points
### Step 5: 
Print the answer with appropriate data type.
### PROGRAM:

import math
x1=10
x2=4
y1=6
y2=2

d=math.sqrt((x2-x1)**2+(y2-y1)**2)
d=round(d,2)
print(float(d))
```
  


### OUTPUT:
